The ground truth for the first image is {'attacking_52.jpg': {'verb': 'attacking', 'frames': {'place': 'room', 'agent': 'man', 'victim': 'man', 'weapon': 'knife'}}}. Generate the ground truth for the second image based in the same format as the first image. 

The ground truth for the first image is {'attacking_52.jpg': {'verb': 'attacking', 'frames': {'place': 'room', 'agent': 'man', 'victim': 'man', 'weapon': 'knife'}}}. Meta-reasoning is the process of deducing the ground truth of an image based on 3 chains of thoughts. An example would be to use the 3 chains of thoughts for the first image to deduce the above ground truth. Can you perform meta-reasoning on the 3 chains of thoughts of the second image, and acquire the ground truth in the above form?

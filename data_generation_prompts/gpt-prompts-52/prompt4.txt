The ground truth for the first image is {'attacking_52.jpg': {'verb': 'attacking', 'frames': {'place': 'room', 'agent': 'man', 'victim': 'man', 'weapon': 'knife'}}}. Meta-reasoning is the process of deducing the ground truth of an image based on 3 chains of thoughts. Here is a justification for the meta-reasoning the first image, based on the previous 3 chains of thoughts of the first image: {What is the event happening in the image? What are the noun entities involved in this event? In the image, a group of men is standing next to another man on his stomach in a large room. Then men seem to be an ongoing assult, with the group of men attacking the man on the ground. The attackers are likely holding knives. Therefore, I conclude that the ground truth for the image is: {'attacking_52.jpg': {'verb': 'attacking', 'frames': {'place': 'room', 'agent': 'man', 'victim': 'man', 'weapon': 'knife'}}}}. Explain to me how meta-reasoning works (including the justification).
